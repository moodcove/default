- 👋 Hey, this is @mwoodcove, with a mission to support, empower, and inform.
- 👀 I’m interested in building on already existing knowledge and contributing to the development of existing ideas.
- 🌱 I’m still learning and currently in the process of building a website, which aims at supporting those living with poor mental health.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects, which can enable people to engage with services from the comfort of their home or safe space.
- 📫 You can best reach me currently, by using GitHub.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun Fact: “Jay” was slang for a foolish person. So, when a pedestrian ignored street signs such as traffic lights, the term “jaywalker" was coined.
